My name is **Sergi Sanchez Orvay**, and I am an aspiring robotics researcher dedicated to advancing the field of **embodied intelligence**. I am currently a Robotics Research Intern at **BMW Group's RoboTac Lab** in Munich, working under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Mohsen Kaboli**, while pursuing my **MSc in Robotics, Systems and Control** at **ETH Zürich**. My academic foundation was built at **Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya**, where I completed my **BSc in Electronic Engineering and Telecommunications** and conducted research at the **IRI-CSIC** (Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial) on vision algorithms for **event-cameras**.

My work and interests are focused on pioneering the next generation of **intelligent, general-purpose robot**s. My approach in **embodied AI and robotic foundation models** emphasizes leveraging **representational learning** and **world models** to create systems that learn from interaction and generalize across complex **robotic manipulation** tasks. My ultimate goal is to drive the **efficiency** of this learning process, bringing it closer to how humans acquire knowledge about the world through experience.

## Experience

### Robotics Research Intern, BMW Group (RoboTac Lab)
*Munich, Germany | Sept. 2025 – Present*
* Conducting research at the intersection of embodied intelligence, cross-modal perception, and robotic manipulation.
* Focused on building robotic foundation models that unify tactile sensing, visual observations, and action sequences into a shared representation using transformers and variational inference in PyTorch.
* Contributing in parallel to the PHASTRAC project (Horizon Europe), utilizing Oscillatory Neural Networks to advance efficient edge intelligence for robotics.

### Student Researcher, ETH Zürich (Vision for Robotics Lab)
*Zürich, Switzerland | Feb. 2025 – July 2025*
* Advanced continuous-time SLAM through Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP).
* Focused on analyzing and resolving numerical instabilities of Hyperion, the first open-source continuous-time GBP solver.
* Designed and implemented improved regularization strategies, including diagonal and Levenberg-Marquardt regularization, message damping, and spline tail-fixing, enabling stable on-line optimization.
* These improvements yielded millimeter-level trajectory accuracy and runtime reductions of more than 100x compared to Ceres-based Non-Linear-Least-Squares solvers.

### Robotics Research Intern, Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial (IRI-CSIC)
*Barcelona, Spain | Sept. 2023 – July 2024*
* Research on lightweight, interpretable algorithms for motion and feature estimation using event cameras on an agile aerial robotic platform.
* Developed and implemented methods for event-based optical flow estimation using plane-fitting techniques on surfaces of active events.
* Designed a geometric model-based pipeline for egomotion estimation, combining normal flow, inverse depth optimization, and RANSAC-based motion recovery using MATLAB and ROS2.
